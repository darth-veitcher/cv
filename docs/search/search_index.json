My background in external audit has allowed me to apply a rigorous scientific method approach to data analysis projects within businesses, ensuring transparency at all times. I passionately believe in the convergence of business processes, data analytics, mobile employees and platform agnostism to bring major improvements and efficiencies to both pre-existing and new problems. My current role allows me to pursue all of the above with the freedom and scope to innovate as necessary. ACCA qualified in 2008 I scored the highest mark globally in Paper 8 Implementing Audit Procedures. Previous awards for work within the UK include multiple TICE-E business unit role model awards, including the performance on a working capital project and an award for knowledge sharing across lines of service within PricewaterhouseCoopers. I have a strong team ethos, and work well with senior management, partners and stakeholders. I feel that my major strength is my ability to think laterally when faced with a problem, determining the most commercially efficient and cost-effective method of solving it using the tools available. Colleagues have found it re-assuring to have someone with my finance background and commercial awareness explain technical matters in plain English whilst still being able to challenge subject matter experts acting as consultants where appropriate.
